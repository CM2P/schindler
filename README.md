# Schindler

A passenger's journey goes beyond the elevator trip, there is much more than going up & down. It's about moving from A
to B in a seamless flow without any obstacles. Join us on our journey in elevating passenger experience to the next
level.

We want you to interact with a Schindler digital elevator simulator using our brand new API's to create an application
that can enrich the passenger experience. We are interested in any solution that can seamlessly guide the user or
facilitate the journey to its destination in any kind. You are free to consider a passenger's whole journey that starts
way before entering a building or just focus on giving an awesome experience during the elevator ride. The challenge is
to bring value by socializing, providing information, creating excitement or simply by entertaining via gamification. We
are eager to see how your creativity will elevate the passenger experience to the next level and will encourage people
to interact in different ways with our products!
